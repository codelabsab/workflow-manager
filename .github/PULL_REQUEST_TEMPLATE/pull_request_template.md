## Please, go through these steps before you submit a PR.

1. Make sure that your PR is not a duplicate.
2. If not, then make sure that:

   a. You have done your changes in a separate branch. Branches MUST have descriptive names that start with either the `fix/` or `feature/` prefixes. Good examples are: `fix/signin-issue` or `feature/issue-templates`.

   b. You have a descriptive commit message with a short title (first line).

   c. You have only one commit (if not, squash them into one commit).

3. **After** these steps, you're ready to open a pull request.

   a. Give a descriptive title to your PR.

   b. Describe your changes.

   c. Put `closes #XXXX` in your comment to auto-close the issue that your PR fixes (if such).

**PLEASE REMOVE THIS TEMPLATE BEFORE SUBMITTING**
